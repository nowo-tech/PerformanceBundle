# Performance Bundle Routes
# This file is automatically created when installing the bundle via Symfony Flex
# 
# The routes are imported from the bundle's controller using attributes.
# The prefix and path are configured via nowo_performance.dashboard.prefix and nowo_performance.dashboard.path
# Default prefix is empty and default path is '/performance'
#
# You can customize the routes by:
# 1. Changing the prefix/path in config/packages/nowo_performance.yaml
# 2. Overriding this file to use a different prefix
# 3. Removing this import and importing the routes manually with your own configuration

nowo_performance:
    resource: '@NowoPerformanceBundle/Resources/config/routes.yaml'
    prefix: '%nowo_performance.dashboard.prefix%%nowo_performance.dashboard.path%'
