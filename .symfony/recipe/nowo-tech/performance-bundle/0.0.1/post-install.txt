Performance Bundle has been installed!

The following files have been created:
  - config/packages/dev/nowo_performance.yaml (configuration)

The bundle will automatically track route performance metrics in configured environments.

To use the bundle:
1. Create the database table:
   - Recommended: php bin/console nowo:performance:create-table
   - Alternative: php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
   - Or use migrations: php bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff && php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
2. Make requests to your routes - metrics will be automatically tracked
3. Use the command to manually set/update metrics: php bin/console nowo:performance:set-route <route>

Available commands:
- nowo:performance:create-table - Create the performance metrics database table
- nowo:performance:set-route - Set or update route performance metrics
- nowo:performance:diagnose - Diagnose bundle configuration and query tracking
- nowo:performance:check-dependencies - Check optional dependencies status

The bundle automatically tracks:
- Request execution time
- Database query count
- Query execution time

Metrics are stored in the 'routes_data' table and are only updated if they're worse
(higher request time or more queries) than existing metrics.

You can customize the configuration in config/packages/dev/nowo_performance.yaml.
The bundle works with default values if you delete the config file.
