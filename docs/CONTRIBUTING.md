This project is maintained by [Héctor Franco Aceituno](https://github.com/HecFranco) at [Nowo.tech](https://nowo.tech).

## Development Setup

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nowo-tech/performance-bundle.git
   cd performance-bundle
   ```

2. Start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   make up
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

5. Open a shell in the container (optional):
   ```bash
   make shell
   ```

### Without Docker

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nowo-tech/performance-bundle.git
   cd performance-bundle
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   composer test
   ```

## Branching Strategy

We follow a simplified Git Flow. See [BRANCHING.md](BRANCHING.md) for full details.

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Production releases only |
| `develop` | Development integration |
| `feature/*` | New features |
| `bugfix/*` | Bug fixes |
| `hotfix/*` | Urgent production fixes |

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests and code style checks:
   ```bash
   make qa
   # or without Docker:
   composer qa
   ```
5. Commit your changes following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   ```bash
   git commit -m 'feat(scope): add amazing feature'
   ```
6. Push to the branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```
7. Open a Pull Request **to `develop`** (not `main`)

## Coding Standards

- Follow PSR-12 coding style
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits atomic and descriptive

### Without Docker

```bash
# Run all tests
